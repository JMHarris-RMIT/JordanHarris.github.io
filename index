    <h1> Personal Information</h1>
      <h2>Jordan Harris</h2>
        <h2> S3885258</h2>
            <p>Email: s3885258@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
            <p>Personal information: I am a Australian man living south of Perth in Busselton, Western Australia.
            I work full time as a wood machinist and I am studying computer science at RMIT. In my free time I like to play drums in a local band, play games of  Warhammer : Age of Sigmar and run a scout group. </p>

    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
          <p> I have always had an interest in IT, I spent most of my teenage years gaming on my PC and developed an interest from there. In high school I studied computer science as an elective and did quite well. I stopped studying IT as work and other interests took precedence but I have always maintained an interest in computers and technology. I have experience in building PC's as well as a basic understanding of coding and the underlying principles of computing.</p>
          <p>I chose to study with RMIT due to the flexibility of courses and the way online study is conducted. I have studied online at different universities and RMIT is the most accessible and straightforward universities I have studied with. As I am now looking to complete a full degree RMIT seems to be the perfect choice. </p>
          <p>While studying at RMIT I expect to learn how to program and work with other people on IT projects. I hope that the combination of Technical and social skills I will learn will set me up to have a successful career in this field. I have an interest in web design and would like to move into that field once my studies are complete so I would expect this degree to lay the groundwork for me to study further and learn more about this field. </p>

    <h1>Ideal job</h1>
      <h2>Web developer:https://www.seek.com.au/job/56077313?type=standout#sol=2a4c2613f8b26eab71b2d8376f567ff1e0fb7820 </h2>
          <p>This position is for someone who has a combination of technical experience and ability to liaise with clients and coworkers to create large web based projects. This job will set me up to have a successful career in this field. I have an interest in web design and would like to move into that field once my studies are complete so I would expect this degree to lay the groundwork for me to study further and learn more about this field.</p>
            <p>This position is appealing to me as this will give me the opportunity to engage with other IT professionals to learn from their experience will discussing and finding solutions to clients issues.  This would be a fantastic opportunity to increase my knowledge and build connections within the industry,</p>
              <p>For this job I will need a wide array of skills. A good working knowledge in Back-end coding using c#, SQL and .Net as well as Front-end skills using Angular, Typescript and Javascript. I will also need to have experience with content management systems. The job listing does not specifically require a degree but as most of the skills required are skills I would learn will obtaining a degree in computer science a degree of this nature would likely be preferable. Other skills that would likely be useful that have not been listed would be the ability to work well with other people and to liaise with clients and stakeholders.<p>
                <p>As of now I lack many of the technical skills required. I have a fairly basic understanding of programming and lack most of the technical expertise required. I do have a have a fair amount of experience working on projects in a group setting and have liaised with clients on said projects in my professional career. </p>
                  <p>To prepare myself for this role I have two main paths that I will follow. I will continue to study computer science and learn what I can in a academic setting while pursuing projects of my own. My hope is that university study will introduce me to new concepts and ideas while laying the groundwork for me to build upon that knowledge and skills in my own time. My hope is that when I have finished my studies I will have a reasonable portfolio that I can bring to job interviews to display my skills. The next step from here would be to find a entry level position where I can build on my skills and gain experience in the industry until I reach a point that I could reasonably apply for this job.</p>

    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
        <h2>Myers-Briggs test: INFJ-A</h2>
          <p><em>"Advocates’ unique combination of personality traits makes them complex and quite versatile. For example, Advocates can speak with great passion and conviction, especially when standing up for their ideals. At other times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and understated, preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge others. They have a deep sense of idealism and integrity, but they aren’t idle dreamers – they take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact.""(16 personalities,2021,par. 1)</em></p>

    <h2>Learning style test: Vark questionnaire.</h2>
        <p>Results from this test would indicate that I have a strong aural learning preference. This would indicate that I prefer to learn through listening, discussing, talking and questioning.</p>
    <h2>Big Five personality test: Empathetic Idealist</h2>
        <p>This result indicates that I use creativity and insight to help others and think about how the world could be a better place.</p>

      <img src="Big5.PNG" alt="Big 5 personality quiz " style="width:400px;height:300px;float:right">

    <p>The results of these tests are interesting but I have some doubts. The results reflect my perception of myself rather than a true reflection of who I am so it is difficult to derive much meaning from the results as I already know how I see myself. I Have taken these tests or similar ones before and the results of the learning style tests have stayed consistent while the personality tests have not. The implication would be that I have learnt more about myself and grown as a person with time.</p>
    <p>I don't really think the results of these test will influence how I work within teams. This is largely due to the fact that I have done these tests before and used this information to inform how I work with other people. I think it is important to always be looking to improve as a team member and to use any available information to further that goal so if this was new information I would certainly take it on board. In the past when I first took tests like this I certainly did take it onboard and use the results to analyse my actions and see where my communication skills could be improved.
    </p>
    <p>I think the most important use for tests like these is to identify 'blind spots' within your own ideas and behaviour patterns. Due to the fact that choosing our teams is often outside of our control, tests like this shouldn't be used to determine the roles that individuals should take as experience and skill level will often take precedence. Instead it is far more productive to interpret these results on a individual level help reduce 'sticking' points within the team. If my test results would indicate that I like to take a leadership role, instead of inserting myself into that role I should try to stay aware of this tendency and watch myself to make sure I don't overstep my role. This leads to a cohesive team and reduces conflict.</p>

    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar is a fantasy tabletop war game which is played using distinct models that each have unique rules and characteristics. The game is played by thousands of people worldwide and while much beloved, the game can be almost impenetrable to new players. This is due largely to the extremely large number of complicated rules that are included within the game. Players may be expected to be aware of over a hundred unique rules and characteristics during a game, on top of the already complex standard game mechanics. This means that for most new players the game is confusing and forgetting things is commonplace. My goal is to create a website that will allows players to input the pieces they wish to use and will provide them with a guide with the relevant rules as well as allowing them to keep track of scores and other miscellaneous information.</p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>I have been playing Age of Sigmar for a year and am now only coming to terms with the rule set. It is such a commonplace occurrence that rules are neglected or players unwittingly 'cheat' by forgetting or misremembering rules that official tournaments will ignore 'accidental' cheating. I have had this experience myself, I misremembered a rule in a way that gave me a massive advantage during a tournament. This was a very negative experience as I felt incredibly guilty afterwards. Having a interactive website that will guide the players through the game will not only improve the fairness of the game but will also mean that players can focus on strategy leading more satisfying games.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This website will work by asking players to select the models they wish to use in the game as well as any other  rules which they wish to use. This can be done through various drop down menus which the user can use to input their army selection. Once this has been completed the user can select to start the battle. The data for each model is freely available so can be recorded in a database that will be updated when new rules are released. There are in game restrictions on which models    the player can bring and these can be included within the selection sequence.
      A game of Age of Sigmar follows a very strict sequence of rounds, each consisting of a number of phases, that will always remain the same. This means that when the player has selected the army and rules they wish to use, the relevant data can be loaded and displayed at the correct time. This means that as the player progresses through the different phases each rule can be displayed when it is relevant.
      Another feature that can aid players would be including a function to keep track of the 'status' of each model. Each model can take a number of wounds before it is removed from play, as well as a number of status effects that can be applied. Each model will be displayed with all the relevant data in a onscreen card. When a player selects the card they will be able to alter their score and status. When the model 'dies' the card will become red to represent it is out of play. If the model is not able to be used in the current phase it will instead be displayed in grey.
      The last feature will be a function to keep track of various scores within the game. The player will be asked to enter scores at the appropriate time and the input will be tracked on the screen. The player will also be able to alter scores in case of error.
      When the player begins the battle the screen will display the scores at the top of the page followed by a title displaying what stage the game is in with rules describing what the player can do underneath. The different cards displaying the model will be positioned at the bottom of the screen.</p>

      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>This website will require some dedicated hardware such as a server which users can access. The server will be asked to perform some basic functions so this must be accounted for. The software requirements of the program will be a HTML website that will be responsible for displaying the page to the user. This website will require some back end programming as files and data must be loaded. Free libraries can be used for assets that may be used on the website.
        The rules for Warhammer : Age of Sigmar are able to be used in this fashion as the the content of the original works is not being reproduced in a way that would infringe on the rights of the original copyright holder. If this website or a similar one already existed and was registered to Games Workshop, this could be an infringement but as no such website exists my project will not. Additionally as this website will not make a profit, deny profit to the original copy right holder or claim to own the rights to any of content used, this use is protected under the Copyright act of 1968. The Copyright Act 1968 does not protect names or titles unless they are trade marked. While 'Warhammer' and 'Age of Sigmar' are trademarks and their use will need to be circumvented (AOS is a commonly used abbreviation that can be used instead) no other trademarks have been registered so model and ability names are able to be used. For reference similar fan sites such as AOS reminders (https://aosreminders.com/) have been in operation for many years. </p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
      <p>The skills required will be a good understanding of HTML as well as a good understanding of data bases. To complete this website, software would need to be written to load data from a database and display it as needed. This can be achieved by creating an initial file using the user inputs. To improve server efficiency this file could be hosted on the user device. Once the file has been created any changes that need to be made throughout the program will occur in the back end file with the website using data from that file to display the results. The hardware required should be minimal, with only a server and some server side storage required. Some servers side coding may also be required to retrieve and store data.</p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The outcome for this website will be a usable resource that players old and new can use to make the game more approachable and fun to play. Mental strain on players will be reduced and any confusion on rules can be reduced or quickly resolved as instead of players having to stop to search for relevant rules, they will have them ready. This development will reduce mental strain and 'book keeping' meaning players have a more enjoyable experience as they can focus on playing the game and having fun.</p>
